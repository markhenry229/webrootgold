        <li>On a card inside the software box (if bought from a store like <strong>Best Buy</strong>)</li>
        <li>In your <strong>Geek Squad</strong> service documents if they installed it for you</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Go to "Programs and Features"</li>
        <li>Find <strong>Webroot SecureAnywhere</strong>, click it, and select "Uninstall"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After uninstalling, you’re ready to perform a fresh install.</p>

        <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation</li>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Common Scenarios Covered</h2>
